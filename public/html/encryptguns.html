    <h1> Guns and Encryption </h1>
    <p> <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/12/what-the-government-shouldve-learned-about-backdoors-from-the-clipper-chip/">Ars Technica article</a> on 90's crypto battles cites Whitfield Diffie:</p>
    <p>"as Diffie pointed out, if [strong] encryption was criminal then only criminals would have strong encryption."</p>

    <p>"I'm pro-encryption and anti-gun. Yet these same arguments when applied to gun control make me rethink my anti-gun position."</p>

    <p>They really shouldn't, because Ars' paraphrasing of Diffie is totally nonsensical!</p>

    <p>If the sale and manufacture of guns in the United States were banned, it would become very difficult to produce perfectly machined killing devices like an AR-15 in any significant quantity. Cruder weapons could and would continue to be manufactured illegally, but in much reduced quantities. Some guns could be smuggled in as well. Still, guns would become very expensive. Well-functioning automatic weapons would become exceedingly rare over a few decades as existing arsenals inevitably rusted over. (Correct me if you're a gunsmith and I'm making bad assumptions).</p>

    <p>Banning the distribution and development of cryptographic technology wouldn't impede its distribution or development at all, as software development does not benefit from economies of scale in the way that manufactured goods do. A single person in their basement can develop new cryptography and distribute it over the still unbroken cryptographic channels we make use of today.</p>

    <p>Banning guns would reduce their availability to violent people and average Joes alike over time. Banning strong encryption would not reduce its availability to either constituency.</p>

    <p>Therefore, banning crypto would not make a difference towards resolving the problems that action aims to resolve. Banning guns, however, would make a difference towards resolving the problems that action aims to resolve. If crypto was criminal, criminals and non-criminals alike would still use it. If gun manufacture was criminal, criminals and non-criminals alike would have reduced access to them.</p>
